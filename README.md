Code Sandbox is for software developers so that they can quickly code and create prototypes.
e.g. Your Project File is large and contains a lot of code, so what you can do if you have to test a smaller part, you have to recompile the code which takes time, instead you can create a seprate sandbox of the code you want to test. 
Through this, you save alot of your time ðŸ˜Š
